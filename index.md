# About

I an Electrical and Computer Engineering Master's student with a specialization in Machine Learning Data Science at University of California San Diego. I'm interested in applications of machine learning in areas such as computer vision, time series forecasting, quantitative finance, cybersecurity and more. I will be graduating in March of 2022 and am looking for full time positions in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering.  

Before Studying at UCSD, I studied Computer Engineering at Michigan State University, and later worked as a software integration engineer at General Motors where I worked on autonomous driving development.

# Projects 

### Stock Price Prediction With Convex Neural Networks -[Paper](https://github.com/jboboyle/jboboyle.github.io/tree/gh-pages/docs/ECE_271B__Final_Report.pdf)
- Using the ideas presented by (Pilanci and Ergen 2020), formulated a two-layer neural network into its dual form equivalent convex network.
- Compared convex network performance with a standard (non-convex) two-layer ReLU in predicting a scalar price change in stock data.
- Implemented a naive trading bot using network predictions to evaluate each modelâ€™s deployment feasibility

### [Mus-X](https://github.com/jboboyle/ECE229) - A Dashboard for Personalized Music Recommendation and Self Discovery
- Created an AWS hosted web-application to provide Spotify users to a platform to learn about their music listening tastes and trends.
- Built interactive UI displays and created a music recommender system using collaborative filtering and cosine similarity. 

### [SGL-DANN](https://github.com/jboboyle/jboboyle.github.io/tree/gh-pages/docs/SGL-DANN.pdf) - Domain Adaptation using Small Group Learning Framework
- Worked with a team of graduate students to build upon a ML model based on human peer to peer learning known as small group learning (SGL) (Du and Xie, 2020). 
- Integrated domain-adversarial neural networks into SGL model approach to evaluate SGL as a solution to domain adaption problems.  

### Deep Embedded Clustering of Antarctic Seismic Data
- Implemented a deep embedded clustering (DEC) model to interpret unlabeled seismic data collected from Antarctica.
- Tested a new DEC model by replacing the autoencoder with U-Net to compare clustering performance between the two approaches.

### About Me
I'm a graduate student studying machine learning with interests including computer vision, image to text translation, NLP, recommender systems, quantitative finance and more!
I'm currently a second year master's student at the University of California, San Diego specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science. 

Before Studying at UCSD, I studied Computer Engineering at Michigan State University, and later worked as a software integration engineer at General Motors where I worked on l2 and L2+ autonomous vehicles. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jboboyle/Pages/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jboboyle/Pages/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
